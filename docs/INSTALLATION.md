# Installation guide — Supertext Translation for django CMS

For administrators and developers who install and set up the package. Editors find their part in the [user guide](USER_GUIDE.md).

## Requirements

- django CMS 4.1 or later (tested with 5.1), Django 4.2 or later, Python 3.10 or later (tested up to 3.14)
- More than one language in `LANGUAGES` / `CMS_LANGUAGES`
- [djangocms-text](https://github.com/django-cms/djangocms-text) (or another text plugin with a `body` field) for rich text
- A Supertext account ([log in or create one](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin)) and an API key from [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (see [API key](#api-key))
- The server must reach `https://api.supertext.com` over HTTPS

## Install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Supertext/djangoCMS-Supertext-Translation.git
```

(Publishing to PyPI as `djangocms-supertext-translation` is planned.)

Add the app and migrate:

```python
# settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...,
    "djangocms_supertext",
    "cms",
    ...,
]
```

```bash
python manage.py migrate djangocms_supertext
```

No URLs need to be added: the package's pages live in the Django admin. It adds:

- *Translate with Supertext…* to the django CMS toolbar's **Language** menu (edit mode),
- *Supertext → Supertext translations* in the admin (a log of all translations) with *Settings and connection* for superusers,
- the management commands `supertext_translate` and `supertext_check`,
- a public ping endpoint for Supertext's reachability check (see [Version information and the API key check](#version-information-and-the-api-key-check)).

Optional: if your admin isn't reachable from the internet (an IP allowlist, a VPN), give the ping endpoint a public address outside the admin:

```python
# urls.py (inside or outside i18n_patterns)
urlpatterns += [path("supertext/", include("djangocms_supertext.urls"))]   # → /supertext/ping
```

### Update

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Supertext/djangoCMS-Supertext-Translation.git
python manage.py migrate djangocms_supertext
```

See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

### Uninstall

Remove `"djangocms_supertext"` from `INSTALLED_APPS` after running `python manage.py migrate djangocms_supertext zero` (which drops the translation log, the chosen Supertext languages and the package's state table), then `pip uninstall djangocms-supertext-translation`. Translations already made are normal page content and stay.

## API key

1. **No Supertext account yet?** [Create one at supertext.com](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin) (the same page logs you in if you already have one; you sign in with your email address).
2. **Generate the API key** at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api). Only users with the **Admin** role in the Supertext account can do this; otherwise ask your account's admin.

Set the key as an environment variable of the server:

```bash
SUPERTEXT_API_KEY="your-key"
```

You can paste it with or without the `Supertext-Auth-Key ` prefix that Supertext shows; the package sends it as `Authorization: Supertext-Auth-Key <key>`. Alternatively set `"API_KEY"` in the `SUPERTEXT` setting (below); the environment variable wins. Keep the key out of your repository.

The package checks the key automatically (see [Version information and the API key check](#version-information-and-the-api-key-check)) and shows the latest result on the settings page: *Supertext → Supertext translations → Settings and connection* (superusers). **Test connection** there, or `python manage.py supertext_check`, checks it again. Both call a cost-free endpoint of the Supertext API. While no key is set or Supertext rejects it, the settings page, the translate dialog and `supertext_check` link to the account signup and the API key page. The settings page also shows the installed *Plugin version* (django CMS doesn't list app versions in its admin); a release version links to its release notes on GitHub.

![The Supertext settings page: "API key checked: the connection to Supertext works." with its time, the API key's source, the live API address, the timeout, the plugin version, links to create a Supertext account and to generate the API key, Send version information to Supertext: On with the ping address, and the Languages table with a Supertext language select and a form of address per django CMS language](images/06-settings.png)

## Languages

The package translates between the languages django CMS is configured with (`LANGUAGES` and `CMS_LANGUAGES` per site), e.g.:

```python
LANGUAGES = [
    ("en", "English"),
    ("de-ch", "Deutsch (Schweiz)"),
    ("fr-ch", "Français (Suisse)"),
    ("it-ch", "Italiano (Svizzera)"),
]
```

Each django CMS language needs a Supertext language. **Choose it on the settings page** (*Django admin → Supertext → Supertext translations → Settings and connection → Languages*, superusers): one row per django CMS language (of all sites, the source language included), with a select of all Supertext languages ("Name (code)") and, where Supertext offers it for the chosen language, the form of address. *Save languages* stores the choices in the database (table `djangocms_supertext_languagesetting`, migration `0003_language_setting`); only codes from Supertext's list are accepted. One choice serves both directions: a language chosen as `de-CH` is translated into `de-CH` and from `de`.

![The Languages table on the Supertext settings page: English en with "English (United States) (en-US)" preselected as a suggestion and "No choice for this language" as form of address; Deutsch (Schweiz), Français (Suisse) and Italiano (Svizzera) with German, French and Italian (Switzerland) and "Formal (Sie, vous)"; the Save languages button](images/08-languages.png)

Supertext accepts exactly these target codes (from its `features` list, October 2026), which is what the select offers:

| Language | Supertext codes |
| --- | --- |
| German, English, French, Italian, Portuguese | `de-DE`, `de-CH`, `de-AT`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, `fr-FR`, `fr-CH`, `it-IT`, `it-CH`, `pt-PT`, `pt-BR` |
| Chinese, Serbian | `zh-Hans`, `zh-Hant`, `sr-Latn`, `sr-Cyrl` |
| Swiss German | `gsw-u-sd-chzh` (Zurich), `gsw-u-sd-chbe` (Bern) |
| All others, without region | `bg`, `cs`, `da`, `el`, `es`, `fi`, `hr`, `hu`, `ja`, `ko`, `nb`, `nl`, `pl`, `rm`, `ru`, `sk`, `sl`, `sq`, `sv`, `tr` |

A language nobody has chosen a Supertext language for is translated with the **suggestion** the select shows preselected (the Supertext SDK's default), so obvious languages work without any setup:

| django CMS code | Supertext language used until you choose another one |
| --- | --- |
| a Supertext code apart from case and `_`/`-` | that code: `de-ch` → `de-CH`, `fr_ch` → `fr-CH`, `es`, `nl`, `zh-hant` → `zh-Hant` |
| `de`, `en`, `fr`, `it`, `pt` | `de-DE`, `en-US`, `fr-FR`, `it-IT`, `pt-PT` |
| `zh`, `zh-cn`, `zh-sg` / `zh-tw`, `zh-hk`, `zh-mo` | `zh-Hans` / `zh-Hant` |
| `sr` | `sr-Latn` |
| a region of a language Supertext has without region | the bare code: `es-es` → `es`, `sl-si` → `sl`, `nl-be` → `nl` |
| anything else (`en-ie`, `de-li`, `gsw`, `sr-rs`, `no`, …) | none: the select shows *— choose —* and the row is marked; until you choose one, translating into it is reported as *has no Supertext language yet* and nothing is sent for it |

- Choose another language where the suggestion isn't what your site means, e.g. `de-CH` for a `de` site in Switzerland, `en-GB` for British English, `nb` for `no`.
- The source language is sent without region (`en-gb` → `en`; `de` chosen as `de-CH` translates from `de`).
- Formal/informal is only offered where Supertext has it (not for English, Swiss German, Romansh, Albanian and Serbian).
- **Override for automated setups:** a `code` (and/or `politeness`) under `SUPERTEXT["LANGUAGES"]` in the settings (below) wins over the settings page. That row's select is then disabled and says *Set under LANGUAGES in the SUPERTEXT setting*. Sites that configured `LANGUAGES` before keep working unchanged; to manage a language on the settings page instead, remove its entry from `LANGUAGES`.

The editors see the languages in the toolbar's *Language* menu:

## Permissions

Editors need:

- **djangocms_supertext | Supertext translation | Can translate pages with Supertext** (`djangocms_supertext.translate`)
- permission to change the page (with `CMS_PERMISSION = True`, django CMS's page permissions; otherwise the model permissions `cms.change_page`, `cms.add_pagecontent`, `cms.change_pagecontent`)
- the permissions of the plugins on the page (e.g. `djangocms_text | text | Can add/change/delete text`), because translating copies the plugins into the target language

Superusers additionally see the settings page. The log (*Supertext translations*) is visible with `djangocms_supertext.view_translation`.

## Settings

All settings are optional and go in one dict:

```python
SUPERTEXT = {
    "API_KEY": "",                    # or the SUPERTEXT_API_KEY environment variable (wins)
    "ENVIRONMENT": "live",            # live | staging | testing
    "API_URL": "",                    # custom base URL; or SUPERTEXT_API_URL (wins)
    "LANGUAGES": {                    # optional: overrides the settings page's Languages table
        "de-ch": {"politeness": "more"},             # formal (Sie, vous)
        "fr": {"code": "fr-CH", "politeness": "less"},  # other Supertext code, informal (du, tu)
    },
    "TIMEOUT": 180,                   # seconds to wait for one language
    "PLUGIN_FIELDS": {                # more plugin fields to translate (merged with the defaults)
        "HeroPlugin": {"heading": "text", "content": "html"},
    },
    "VERSION_REPORTS": True,          # "Send version information to Supertext"; SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS=0 (wins)
    "SITE_URL": "",                   # the site's public address for version reports, e.g. "https://www.example.ch"
}
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `API_KEY` | – | Supertext API key; the environment variable `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` takes precedence. |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | `live` | `live` (`https://api.supertext.com/v1/`), `staging` or `testing`. |
| `API_URL` | – | A different base URL (proxy, test server); `SUPERTEXT_API_URL` takes precedence. |
| `LANGUAGES` | `{}` | Optional override of the settings page's [Languages](#languages) table, for automated setups. Per django CMS language code: `code`, the Supertext language (one of the [Supertext codes](#languages), e.g. `de-CH`, `es`, `zh-Hans`; as source its language without region is sent), and `politeness`: `more` formal, `less` informal, `default` (only for languages that offer it). A value set here wins over the settings page, whose select for it is then disabled. |
| `TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds to wait for the translation of one language. |
| `POLL_INTERVAL` | `2` | Seconds between status checks. |
| `PLUGIN_FIELDS` | see below | Plugin type → `{model field: "text" or "html"}`. |
| `VERSION_REPORTS` | `True` | **Send version information to Supertext** (see below). `False` turns it off; the environment variable `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS` (`0`/`false`/`off`/`no` or `1`/`true`/`on`/`yes`) takes precedence. |
| `SITE_URL` | – | The site's public base URL sent with version reports and used for the ping address. Default: the address of the admin request (scheme and host); commands use the Django site's domain (not `example.com`). |

**Plugins translated out of the box:** `TextPlugin` (`body`, HTML; djangocms-text and djangocms-text-ckeditor), `LinkPlugin` (`name`; djangocms-link), `PicturePlugin` (`caption_text`), `FilePlugin` (`file_name`), `VideoPlayerPlugin` (`label`). Add your own plugins with `PLUGIN_FIELDS`; all other plugins are copied into the new language unchanged.

## Version information and the API key check

**Send version information to Supertext** is on by default. The package then tells Supertext which version runs where, after an update and when the API key check result changes, so Supertext support can see which version you run. A report contains exactly: the site URL (`SITE_URL`, else the address of the admin request), the package's name and version, the django CMS and Python versions, the Supertext SDK version, whether a key is set, the result of the API key check below (status, time, HTTP status, Supertext's error code) and the address of the ping endpoint. **No content, no API key and no personal data are sent.** Reports go from the server (after the admin page has been sent, so they never slow it down), never from the browser; a report that fails is not retried for an hour and never breaks a page or a translation. `supertext_check` sends one report on demand. Turn it off with `"VERSION_REPORTS": False` in `SUPERTEXT` or the environment variable `SUPERTEXT_VERSION_REPORTS=0`: nothing is sent at all then, and the ping endpoint answers 404. The settings page shows whether it's on.

**The API key check** runs whether or not version information is sent: when the package's admin pages or commands run with a key it hasn't checked yet (the key is compared by a fingerprint stored in the database, never the key itself), on **Test connection**, in `supertext_check`, and when Supertext rejects the key during a translation. It's Supertext's cost-free `features` call; nothing is translated or billed. The settings page shows the latest result with its time: *the connection works*, *Supertext rejected the API key* or *no API key is set* (both with the links to create an account and generate a key), *Supertext can't be reached* or *Supertext answered with an error*.

**The ping endpoint** `GET <site>/<admin>/djangocms_supertext/translation/ping/?challenge=…` (or `/supertext/ping` with the optional URL include above; the settings page shows the address) is public (no login, no session) and answers only `{"ok":true,"plugin":"djangoCMS-Supertext-Translation","challenge":"…"}` with `Cache-Control: no-store`, so Supertext can see that the site is reachable from the internet. It returns nothing else: no versions, no settings, no data.

The package keeps this state (what was reported last, the latest key check) in its table `djangocms_supertext_state` (migration `0002_state`).

## Interface languages

The *Translate with Supertext* dialog, the settings page, the translation log and all Supertext messages are available in English, German, French and Italian. They follow each user's django CMS interface language: *site name menu → User settings → Language* in the toolbar, otherwise the browser's language through Django's `LocaleMiddleware`. A language is only offered if it is in your `LANGUAGES` setting; other languages fall back to English. The `manage.py` commands print English, and the permission name stays English too (Django stores permission names in the database when it migrates).

## Request timeouts

Translating runs in the editor's request: a few seconds per language, up to `TIMEOUT` for very long pages. Make sure your web server and proxy allow that (e.g. gunicorn `--timeout 300`).

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| No *Translate with Supertext…* in the Language menu | The toolbar isn't in edit mode, the app isn't in `INSTALLED_APPS`, or the user lacks `djangocms_supertext.translate` or permission to change the page. |
| *Supertext is not set up yet* in the dialog | `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY` is not set on the server. Generate a key at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (Admin role) and set it. |
| *Authentication failed. Please check the Supertext API key.* | Wrong or revoked key, or a key for another environment. Generate a new one at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (Admin role) and use *Test connection*. |
| *This language is published. Create a draft of it, then translate again.* | With djangocms-versioning, only drafts can be changed. Create a draft of that language (or delete the language) and translate again. |
| *The language … has no Supertext language yet* / *No Supertext language: choose one* on the settings page | The django CMS code isn't a Supertext code and has no default (e.g. `en-ie`, `gsw`): choose its Supertext language under *Supertext → Supertext translations → Settings and connection → Languages* (see [Languages](#languages)). |
| *Supertext does not support this language pair (en → xx-YY)* | A `code` in `SUPERTEXT["LANGUAGES"]` Supertext doesn't offer (e.g. `es-ES` instead of `es`), or the same language as source and target. Fix it (or remove it and choose the language on the settings page); the message shows the codes that were sent. |
| *Supertext offers no formal or informal tone for this language* | `politeness` under `SUPERTEXT["LANGUAGES"]` is `more`/`less` for a language without it (English, Swiss German, Romansh, Albanian, Serbian); remove it. Nothing is sent for that language until then. |
| *Supertext rejected the API key* on the settings page | The key is wrong or revoked. Check that the whole key was copied into `SUPERTEXT_API_KEY`, or generate a new one at [supertext.com → Integrations → API](https://www.supertext.com/en/integrations/api) (Admin role). No Supertext account yet? [Create one at supertext.com](https://www.supertext.com/person/en/account/signin). Then *Test connection*. |
| *The API key couldn't be checked because Supertext can't be reached* | The server can't reach `api.supertext.com` (firewall, proxy, DNS). Translations need the same connection. |
| *Too many requests to Supertext* | The API's per-second limit was hit repeatedly although the package retries. Try again shortly. |
| *Timed out waiting for the Supertext translation* or a 502/504 from the proxy | Very long page: raise `TIMEOUT` and the web server's request timeout. |
| A plugin's text stays in the source language | Its plugin type isn't in `PLUGIN_FIELDS`. Add it. |
| *Your Supertext translation limit is exceeded.* | The Supertext subscription's quota is used up. |

Errors are also logged (logger `djangocms_supertext`). More technical details are in the [developer guide](DEVELOPER.md).
